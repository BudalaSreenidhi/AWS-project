# AWS-project
I tried to learn about AWS servers by building a calculator.
Project Description: 
To design and build a simple web application from scratch. We’ll pick five different services—Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB—and talk about why/where to use them, and how to get them to work with each other. As we go, we’ll build out each of the services, resulting in a fullyfunctional math web application. 
Services:
1)Amplify:
•	Creating an index.html page from scratch in a text editor.
•	Deploying and hosting a web page with AWS Amplify.
•	Invoking the API Gateway endpoint from the index.html page in Amplify
•	Re-deploying our index.html page using Amplify 
2)Lambda:
•	Creating a Python Lambda function to implement our math functionality.
•	Configure the Test events in the lambda function.
•	Testing our Lambda function .
3)API Gateway:
•	Creating a REST API for our Lambda function using API Gateway
•	To persist our math result to a database, and also handle permissions
•	Updating the index.html page to call API Gateway
4)DynamoDB:
•	Creating a new DynamoDB table to store our math result. 
•	Giving Lambda permission to write to the DynamoDB table
•	Updating the Lambda function code to write to the DynamoDB table
5)IAM:
•	By using IAM Roles, we attached DynamoDB with a lambda policy.
